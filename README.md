## 🛠️ How the Dashboard Was Built
The dashboard was created in **Tableau**, focusing on **key metrics across multiple sheets**, each using a different visualization technique to best represent the insights.

### 🔍 **Visualizations Used:**

1. **Total Shows by Country 🌍**  
   - Used a **dark background map** to highlight which countries have the most shows.
   - Higher concentrations are visually emphasized for easy interpretation.

2. **Top 10 Genres 🎭**  
   - Displayed as a **sorted horizontal bar chart**, making it easier to compare genre popularity.

3. **Shows by Type 🍿📺**  
   - Used a **donut chart** to represent the proportion of **TV Shows vs. Movies**.

4. **Shows by Release Year 📅**  
   - Displayed as an **area chart** to visualize how the number of available movies and TV shows has changed over time.

5. **Top Rated Shows by Age Rating 🏆**  
   - Used an **intricate Radial Bar Chart** to highlight which **age categories (e.g., 13+, 16+, PG, etc.)** have the highest-rated content.

### 🎨 **Dashboard Formatting & Design**
To ensure **visual consistency** and align with Amazon Prime's branding:
- The **background and chart colors were styled to match Amazon Prime's dark blue color palette**.
